# This is a repository of different snippets of code and mini-projects.

## Arduino
Arduino code for a custom auto top-off unit for a fish tank. It uses multiple float values or optical water level sensors to monitor the water level of a tank, then turns on a pump to top the tank up when required. This device is used for maintaining consistent water level in a salt water reef tank to ensure constant salinity.

## DataGeneticsSolutions
This collection of source code files are examples of solutions to the DataGenetics Coffee Time Challenges

## MapSortedByInsertion
Some simple code for a map that stores the order of insertion. This is used in the Casal2 project to allow us to map different lists of text inputted by the user towards category lists. 

## PlayingWithCode
Just playing with some different code and methods in Python.
